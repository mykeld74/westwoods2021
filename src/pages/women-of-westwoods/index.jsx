              The Women's Ministry of Westwoods is an arm of the church that
              provides opportunities for every woman to connect relationally, be
              encouraged in their walk with Jesus, and equipped to impact their
              world for the Kingdom. Whether it's through monthly Connect
              events, mom gatherings, focusing on fitness, regular bible study,
              praying together, holiday events, play dates, service
              opportunities, tea and coffee chats, impromptu fun, mentor
              meetings or parenting discussions, there is a place for YOU! Our
              hope is that ladies will be encouraged and challenged by doing
              life and building friendships!
